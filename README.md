# RP1_aluinsertion

The linux program grep to search FASTQ files for the 5' junction of between the reference sequence of exon 4 and the beginning of the Alu insertion in RP1 gene.

Most files without the insertion return a count of "0" though rarely a false-positive read count of 1 or 6 detected in minority of wildtype samples depending on the depth of coverage and the method of sequencing such as targeted, whole exome, or whole genome.

In the datafolder to execute this command to grep Alu-insertion in exon 4 of RP1

This RP1 Alu insertion causes autosomal recessive macular dystrophy with retinitis pigmentosa.

This Alu insertion in RP1 gene seems to be frequently observed in East Asian (Korean, Japanese, ...), probably founder mutation.

# VAF < 0.1 : No AluY insertion was found in exon 4 of RP1 at 8:55540494 position (hg19)

# 0.1 <= VAF < 0.3 : AluY insertion was suspected in exon 4 of RP1 at 8:55540494 position (hg19). Please recheck by visualizing AluY sequence at 8:55540494 position (hg19).

# VAF >= 0.3 : AluY insertion was detected in exon 4 of RP1 at 8:55540494 position (hg19).
